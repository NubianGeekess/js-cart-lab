###About Cart
Cart helps people to keep track of the items when they are shopping to have a knowledge of how many items they are going to purchase finally.

###Objectives
We are going to build a simple Shopping Cart application that will be executed from the browser.

###Features
The Shopping Cart application should enable users:
  + Add new items to Cart
  + Update items in the Cart.
  + Delete items from the Cart.

The Shopping Cart application may possess additional features such as:
  + Persisting the tasks to the browser's local storage.

###Functionality
  +  **Adding new items to Cart**
  When the user clicks the 'Add To Cart' button after typing text into the various input fields, a new item is added to the Cart and appears below the previous task.
  +  **Update items in the Cart**
  When the user clicks on the 'edit' button, the user should be able to edit the items in the Cart and press ENTER to update those values.
  +  **Deleting items from the Cart**
  When the user clicks on the 'delete' button, the user should be able to delete the items in the Cart.


###Constraints
The Shopping Cart application must meet the following constraints:
**Technical Constraints**
  + The application must be built with the jQuery Javascript library.
  + The application must utilize the OLP.

**Design Constraints**
  + The various sections and elements of the Shopping Cart application are built by making each of the tests pass accordingly. Do well not to skip or delete any of the tests. They are very necessary in building every bit of the application.
